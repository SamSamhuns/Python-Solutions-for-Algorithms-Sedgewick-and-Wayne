'''
Give the sequence of values of p and q that are computed when Euclidâ€™s algo-
rithm is used to compute the greatest common divisor of 105 and 24. Extend the code

given on page 4 to develop a program Euclid that takes two integers from the command
line and computes their greatest common divisor, printing out the two arguments for
each call on the recursive method. Use your program to compute the greatest common
divisor or 1111111 and 1234567.
